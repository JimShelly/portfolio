# aurelia-kitchinsink

This is a starter template project fo rthe Aurelia frontend framework.  

I like Aurelia because it is light-weight, performant, feature rich, easy to developer, and reminded me of the Code-behind structure that ASP.Net had.  

#Purpose:

I created this starter template when I worked at Verizon for easily bootstrapping an application.  I did not want to have to start from scratch each time.  

This allowed for faster development.
